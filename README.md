# WARNING: DO NOT USE THE LINKUP SCRIPT WITHOUT READING IT AND KNOWING WHAT IT WILL DO!
# I CAN NOT BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR LOSS OF DATA IF YOU RUN IT WITHOUT LOOKING AT IT FIRST!

-- With that out of the way, on to fun stuff:

A set of dotfiles I use regularly, feel free to do what you want with what's in them.

(If you do happen to make money off them do let me know at least how, or throw a buck my way)

The idea for the linkup was stollen from [Derek Wyatts dot files](https://github.com/derekwyatt/dotfiles)
